# First of all
This project is a batch of `ci-bonfire/Bonfire`.

# Why create a new project
There are lots of broken branchs and the road map is indeterminate.We need to spend a lot of time to fix these problems.

The Bonfire develop branch will be the only branch receiving new features and/or major code changes.

So, ahy not make it better to updated and fantastic.
# Faster Development of CodeIgniter Apps

That's Bonfire's goal: provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications.
It's not a CMS.
Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.

## Lend A Hand

If you're interested in helping out, fork the project and start coding! I'd love to have you on board. You can always shoot me an email at usstpeter@gmail.com and we can talk about how you'll best fit it and what the best place to start coding would be.

Let's make this the best kick-start to any CodeIgniter project.
